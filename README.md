## Conclusion:

Maintenance of the data manually is a tedious task and hence an online database system designed for a library helps in
organising the data of books, authors, dues, etc. and create smooth transactions. We have created a website for this project
and also provided two separate access - one is admin access and second is user access. It also has a facility of admin login
through which the admin can monitor the whole system. It also have a facility where user after log into their accounts can see
list of books issued and its issue date and return date and also the user can request the admin to issue the book.
Users can see which books are available for issuing and which books they have issued in the dashboard. Admin have more
accesses than users. Admin can introduce book categories, and new books, admin can also increase/decrease late fees per day.
He/She can also view the different tables for the issued books and uncleared dues. The login/sign up process is also created
for both user and admin. This facility is also secured as it uses a captcha verification before login or sign up to avoid data
breach from some robot or bot.
